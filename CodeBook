==================================================================

The original dataset was created by the following means:
--------------------------------------------------------
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
-------------------------------
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Feature Selection in the original dataset:
==========================================
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
----------------------------------------------------------------
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only variables estimating mean and standard deviation were kept in the dataset for analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6 activities were originally coded as class 1-6
They were recoded during the analysis as follows:
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
30 individuals were enrolled in the study and identities were recorded as subject id 1-30
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
average feature values were calculated over each activity and subject id
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------
Dataset files used in this analysis:
------------------------------------
- "README.txt"
- "features.txt": list of features
- "activity_labels.txt": list to link class labels with activity name
- "train/X_train.txt": training set
- "train/y_train.txt": training labels
- "train/subject_train.txt": subject who performed the activity in training set (range 1-30)
- "test/X_test.txt": test set
- "test/y_test.txt": test labels
- "test/subject_test.txt": subject who performed the activity in test set (range 1-30)

-----------------------------------------------------
Data files were analyzed using the following methods:
-----------------------------------------------------
- above files were read into RStudio using R version 4.0.4
- column names were added to the X files according to the features file
- test and training X files were combined
- only column names/features containing "mean" or "std" were kept in the dataset
- columns for activity labels and subject id were added to the subsetted data
- activity was recoded with the activity name rather than class label
- dataset was reshaped to become a long dataset for different values of activity and subject
- feature average was calculated over each value of activity and subject
- dataset again reshaped to gather averages into one column for tidy dataset
- final tidy dataset was written out as a text file
